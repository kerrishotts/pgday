Now's your chance to take what you've learned and put it into practice. Why don't you try creating some plugins or extending and improving existing ones?

* Create a new plugin and add it to a Cordova project. Here's some more ideas:
    * Apple Pencil / Stylus support (pressure, tilt)
    * Audio/video processing
    * Faster computation (compared with JavaScript)
* Extend and/or improve an existing plugin
    * Core plugins should adhere to specs when they are available
    * Translate API docs if you know a language other than English
    * Correct and clarify existing docs
    * Add and improve tests and examples
* The sky's the limit!
