Now's your chance to take what you've learned and put it into practice. Why don't you try creating some plugins or extending and improving existing ones?

* Create a new plugin and add it to a Cordova project. Here's some more ideas:
    * Game controller support
    * Apple Pencil / Stylus support (pressure, tilt)
    * Audio/video processing
    * Faster computation (compared with JavaScript)
* Extend and/or improve a plugin
    * For example, the globalization plugin's API is asynchronous, which is really irritating.
        * All the formatting / globalization information could be determined up-front instead
        * Try it: https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-globalization
* The sky's the limit!
